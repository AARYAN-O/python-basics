# keyword parameters: function call
# default parameters: function definition
# in the line just above all the keyword arguments must be at the end.
# Conclusion:in both function call and function definition , we need to have all the positional parameters should 
# be at the end.


# note : When we are having keyword arguments/parameters, we don't need to think a lot about the position of them 
# but when we are having positional arguments/parameters, we need to think about the position of them.
